        Echo Market is offered as a facilitating service to introduce borrowers seeking to lenders offering EchoMarket approved items.</p>
      <p >
        Once a borrower or lender has been introduced, EchoMarket will play no mediating role in that event, except in the case of anonymous item donations.
      </p>

      <p >
        In the aftermath of that event, EchoMarket will offer a 'Satisfaction Survey' either the borrower and the lender, as appropriate.
        If satisfaction is found poor, EchoMarket will then seek more information to determine the continuance of either the borrower or lender participation.
      </p>

        You are required to read

      </p>
      <p >
        Otherwise, thanks for seeking to borrow or lend with EchoMarket.  All the Very Best!
