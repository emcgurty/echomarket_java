                Echo Market is offered as a facilitating service to introduce borrowers to lenders and vice versa.
            </p>

            <p >
                Once a borrower or lender has been introduced, EchoMarket will play no mediating role in that event.
            </p>

            <p >
                In the aftermath of that event, EchoMarket will offer a 'Satisfaction Survey' to both the borrower and the lender.
                If satisfaction is found poor, EchoMarket will then seek more information to determine the continuance of either the borrower or lender participation.
            </p>

            <p >
                Otherwise, thanks for seeking to borrow with EchoMarket.  All the Very Best!
            </p>
        </div>
