Rewriting Echomarket in Java, IDE Netbeans, Faces, Hibernate 

Back in 2000 I was working with Java and Java Servlets.  In the meanwhile I have worked with ColdFusion, PhP. ASP.Net and Ruby on Rails.  I decided to return to Java and re-write an application that I previously wrote in Ruby on Rails.  These are my results...  all work in progress... 

It's been a while since I updated this README.

What's going on with the application.

The basic bones exist...

I need to re-write Search functions because I changed the database.  And I also want to add search option for free, donated, security deposit-required, etc.. offered items to lend.  
I need to build a Community menu. -- done 
I need to clean up presentation, sizing...   
I need to learn how to code in the event of user reload.    
I need to introduce an error page.  
I need to complete Hibernate attributes.  
I need to code for the event of a user deleted.  
I need to understand why <h:graphicImage often fails. -- done 
I need to revisit early code to reflect what I have learned.  
I need to implement address completion based on zip code.  
I need to test and understand various browsers.  I know that IE does not find my Javascript.  
I need feedback in how I am Hibernate coding.  
I need feedback in how I am using face-config.xml and web.xml.    
I need feedback in how I am using @Inject.   
I need advise on deployment.  
And, I need to revisit JavaScript.  I know that I have goofy loops to find elements... Live and learn...  

Future ambitions:  

Registration via FaceBook or LinkedIn...  
Provide GIS Map of Items Sought and Items Offered.  
Make the GUI more attractive.  
Code for cell phone to capture item, bar code, as desired or offered.  
Convert code to Andriod.   
Learn and implement best-practice in deployment.  

Otherwise, I hope you see some value in not only my application but its code.  I am seeking comments on my work, employment in web development... Please contact me...  

Thanks,
