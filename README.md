Rewriting Echomarket in Java, IDE Netbeans, Faces, Hibernate 

Back in 2000 I was working with Java and Java Servlets.  In the meanwhile I have worked with ColdFusion, PhP. ASP.Net and Ruby on Rails.  I decided to return to Java and re-write an application that I previously wrote in Ruby on Rails.  These are my results...  all work in progress... 

What's going on with the application.

The basic bones exist...

I need to re-write Search functions because I changed the database.  Rewrite done but Hibernate results failing.  
I need to complete Hibernate attributes.  
I need to code for the event of a user deleted.  
I need to test and understand various browsers.  I know that IE does not find my Javascript.    
I need feedback in how I am Hibernate coding.   
I need feedback in how I am using face-config.xml and web.xml.    

Future ambitions:  
Registration via FaceBook or LinkedIn...  
Provide GIS Map of Items Sought and Items Offered.  
Make the GUI more attractive.  
Code for cell phone to capture item, bar code, as desired or offered.  
Convert code to Andriod.   
Learn and implement best-practice in deployment.  

Otherwise, I hope you see some value in not only my application but its code.  I am seeking comments on my work, employment in web development... Please contact me...  

Thanks,
