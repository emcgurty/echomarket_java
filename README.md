Rewriting Echomarket in Java, IDE Netbeans, Faces, Hibernate 

Back in 2000 I was working with Java and Java Servlets.  In the meanwhile I have worked with ColdFusion, PhP. ASP.Net and Ruby on Rails.  I decided to return to Java and I have re-written an application in Java.  These are my results...  My effort here is to prove that I have acquired some level of skill in Java.
