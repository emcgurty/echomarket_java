Rewriting Echomarket in Java, IDE Netbeans, Faces, Hibernate 

Back in 2000 I was working with Java and Java Servlets.  In the meanwhile I have worked with ColdFusion, PhP. ASP.Net and Ruby on Rails.  I decided to return to Java and re-write an application that I previously wrote in Ruby on Rails.  These are my results...  all work in progress... 

Like what you see... I am seeking web development work... Please contact me...
